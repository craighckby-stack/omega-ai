# DARLIK KHAN: The Half-Assed AGI Scaffold

## Mission Statement
Rapid iteration and integration of disparate, experimental AI concepts into a single, functional, quick-start scaffold. Efficiency over elegance.

## Source Concepts (Gemini Prototypes)

| Prototype | Link | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Preview Scaffold | `https://gemini.google.com/share/7a8f004e0c20` | Current structure foundation. |
| Secondary Concept | `https://gemini.google.com/share/c0dd4a3ef852` | Initial integration target. |
| Core Mashup Inception | `https://gemini.google.com/share/d31eabdb0e5b` | The raison d'être. |
| Lazy Debugger | `https://gemini.google.com/share/cff3628bfc67` | Utility implementation. |
| Placeholder | `https://gemini.google.com/share/a0013ccc9e93` | TBC concept slot. |
| Viral Link | `https://gemini.google.com/share/249a6d6d4366` | Unspecified concept. |

## Target Feature Integration
Immediate goals for the scaffold:

1.  **The Builder (Z-Engine):** System for user signup, fullstack repo/token ingestion, and autonomous code enhancement based on integrated AI ideas.
2.  **The Debugger (Fix-It-Now):** Gemini utility for automated identification and correction of code flaws (maximizes laziness).
